When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want multiple people to work on the project or when I want to make my code available everywhere
  even though when I'm not using my local computer.
  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  because there might be some other contributor who is changing my code constantly and commiting it so if 
  pulling is done automatically my local code will continously be changing which might break my code. So
  it's always better to pull manually so we know what changes are being made.
  It is easily noticeable for the changes being made when pulling manually rather than automatsic.
